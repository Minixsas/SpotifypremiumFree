This only works for spotify.exe app from their website. If you are using microsoft spotify uninstall it and install the one from spotify website.
************************************************************************************************************************
Usage: Open spotcrack.bat, you can choose if you don't have spotify updated to update it, if you have the latest version
of spotify already just type N, type Y for Remove ad placeholder and upgrade button (that will remove the ads).
And that's it we are done bye :D
